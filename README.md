# Streaks

There's no generally accepted, simple term for a sequence
in which the first element is also its smallest or largest.
I'll call it a "streak."

There are winning streaks, like [1, 5, 7, 2], and losing streaks. like [7, 2, 1, 5].
As in English, when I just say "streak" I usually mean "winning streak" (e.g., "He's really on a streak!"),
but you'll be able to tell by context.

This repo explores the statistics of sequences of streaks.
The code is Python, so a streak is representated as a list, or occasionally a tuple.
A sequence of streaks is a list of such lists.
To avoid edge cases, all streak elements will be unique.

I'm using this project as a way to explore tools, beginning with VSCode, AI code generation, & uv,
followed by wherever that leads.
