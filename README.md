# Lifts

There's no generally accepted, simple term for a sequence in which the first element is also its smallest.
I'll call it a "lift."

This repo explores the statistics of sequences of lifts.
The code is Python, so a lift is representated as a list, or occasionally a tuple.
A sequence of lifts is a list of such lists.
To avoid ties, all elements will be floats.

I'm using this project as a way to explore tools, beginning with VSCode, AI code generation, & uv,
followed by wherever that leads.
